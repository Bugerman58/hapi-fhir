type: fix
issue: 7567
title: "Previously, query string parameters on POST _search requests without a form-encoded body
  were silently ignored (e.g. POST /Patient/_search?_id=aaa). This has been fixed so that
  query string parameters are now correctly parsed for both GET and POST search requests."
