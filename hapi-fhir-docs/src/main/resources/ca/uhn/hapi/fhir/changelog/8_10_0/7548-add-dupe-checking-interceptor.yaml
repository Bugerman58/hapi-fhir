title: "A new interceptor called MemoryBasedDuplicateBlockingInterceptor has been added. This interceptor
  does a basic check upon resource creation to detect other duplicate resources recently created, where
  a duplicate is defined as a resource with the same contents (excluding id, meta, and text elements). If
  a duplicate is detected, it is blocked and an error is returned to the client."
